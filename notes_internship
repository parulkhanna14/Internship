DELETING LINES IN VIM


GIT
→ git init to make new public repo
→ git config --list (will show you the basic info)
→ $ git rm --cached my-file.ts
 (to remove a file from staging area)
→ git reset file5 (opp of add and same as above command)
→ git commit -a[all] -m “msg” (at the same time)
					
UNDO THE COMMIT

→ Git reset --soft HEAD^ (undo the commit and moved before head)
(waps staging area m aata h) Undo the last commit in the current branch and move HEAD back by one commit."
→ git add remaining_file.txt
→ git commit --amend “remaining file”
→ echo "# newrepo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/parulkhanna14/newrepo.git
git push -u origin master
→ -u because next time just write “git push”
→ git branch (lists all branches)
→  git branch user-profile (makes the branch but doesn’t change it)
→ git checkout user-profile
Or simply git -b checkout user-profile
→ merge 
Merges any sub branch to the main branch
Go to main branch and git merge user-profile
→ git branch -d user-profile (deletes a branch)
→ git reset --hard (undo the commit as well as deletes the modifications till the last commit)

→ git revert HEAD (requires a reference here HEAD for the latest commit)
→ reset only works one step back at a time

$git revert HEAD~3
Revert the changes specified by the fourth last commit in HEAD and create a new commit with the reverted changes.
$git revert -n master~5..master~2
Revert the changes done by commits from the fifth last commit in master (included) to the third last commit in master (included), but do not create any commit with the reverted changes. The revert only modifies the working tree and the index.
→ git merge parulkhanna
You make changes to the file in the working directory and then you add those files in the staging area. From that area only files can be committed to the git repository.

General work flow: 
Add
commit
Pull
Push
> First cloned the repository in the local system using the “git clone URL”
> Changed to the new directory
> created a branch using “git checkout -b parulkhanna(branch name)” 
	-b flag means creating a new branch 
	By default a branch is made on another branch (wherever you were working)
	In this case new branch was made based on the master branch itself
	Else you could have given branch name followed by existing branch name 


MERGE
git fetch (so that the files should be updated)
git  branch -va (gives detailed info which repo is behind any updation)

DELETING A BRANCH
git  branch -d <branch name>
https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-merge-branch
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge
 
RESET ::
HARDRESET/SOFTRESET
→ git stash push -m “msg”

Scenario: You have done a git reset --hard for some unwanted changes, but then you realized that you actually needed them.
Solution: git reflog comes to your rescue! It is an amazing command for recovering project history and it can recover almost anything.


SQL

Multiple inserts
Insert into tablename values (),(),();

LIKE 
Select * from first where gender like “%male%”;
%- one or more occurences
_ one occurence

TOP/LIMIT
select * from first where genger="male" limit 3;

DROPPING A NOT NULL CONSTRAINT
alter table second change name name varchar(20);

INSERT CURRENT DATE TIME:
curdate() → but it gives only the date and time as 00:00:00
now() → gives proper date and time of the system

UNION clause
Unions two select statements (must have same columns and in same order as well) but eliminates the duplicate rows

UNION ALL
Includes the duplicate rows as well.

// INTERSECT/EXCEPT

// INTERSECT → which is there in both select statements i.e. the common ones.

// EXCEPT → which is there in the first select statement but not in the second one.

JOIN
Select * from cust,orders where id=custid;

→ Cross join :  select * from  cust cross join orders; 
 Gives all the combinations from rows from first table with each row in table 2. I.e. m*n combinations/rows.

→ Inner join :  intersection
select id,name,oid from cust,orders where cust.id=orders.custid;
OR
select id,name,oid from cust inner join orders on cust.id=orders.custid;
returns rows that satisfy the conditions in both the tables.
 → Outer joins: 
left/right joins
Select id,name,oid from cust LEFT JOIN orders on id=custid;

ON and USING constraints

Same use but USING can be used only on the same column name in both tables.

Subqueries: 

→ Must be enclosed in paranthesis.
→ if inner query returns null then outer query will not return anything if compared in the where clause.

JOINING MORE THAN 2 TABLES
$ select empname from employee inner join empdept on employee.dept=empdept.deptid inner join empsalary USING (empid) where ispermanent='yes' and deptname="HR";






Enabling and disabling keys

ALTER INDEX employees_pk ON employees
DISABLE;

ALTER INDEX employees_pk ON employees
REBUILD;

Adding primary key
$ alter table empdept add PRIMARY KEY (depthead);


Adding foreign key
$ alter table employee add FOREIGN KEY(dept) REFERENCES empdept(deptid);

Drop keys
$ alter table employee drop FOREIGN KEY employee_ibfk_1 , drop KEY dept;

$ create index idx on <table name> (columns);
$show indexes from <tablename>;

$select * from cust use index(idx) where country=”ireland”;

$alter table cust drop PRIMARY KEY;
$alter table cust add PRIMARY KEY(id);

$alter table employee drop FOREIGN KEY <fk name>;
$alter table employee add FOREIGN KEY (dept) REFERENCES empdept(deptid);

$alter table employee add unique (empname);
$alter table employee drop index empname;

$set FOREIGN_KEY_CHECK=0;
$set FOREIGN_KEY_CHECK=1;

NORMALIZATION
→ 1NF
Every column should have single value
Each record must be unique.
→ 2NF
Must be 1NF
Single column pk
→ 3NF
Must be 2NF
No transitive dependencies (all non-key attributes depends on primary key only in all tables)

MAVEN

Software management and comprehension tool based on POM (Project Object Model)
General build system job include: 
Compile source code
Copy resource
Compile and run tests
Package project
Deploy project 
Cleanup 
Maven manages :
→ builds
→ dependencies + versions
→ Documentation

Maven UIDs (Unique Identifiers)
→ group id
→ artifact id
→ version

We can refer to any project using these UIDs and even some one can refer to us using the same.

We can add dependencies using these UIDs

What’s POM?
It’s an XML file containing the project’s information and configuration details used by maven to build the project.
(describes a project, group id,artifact id, version, dependencies, plugins,etc)  
In a POM file (general structure)
<project>
	<groupid>	{apne project ka}
	<artifact id>
	<version>
	<packaging> (jar,war,etc)
<dependencies>
	<dependency>	</dependency> . . . . .
</dependencies>
<build>				//to extend the build process
	<plugins>
		<plugin>	</plugin> . . . . . .
	</plugins>
</build>
</project>

Archetype is nothing but a template.
It’s a plugin which tell maven to create a project of specified template (like quickstart).

                </configuration>
    </plugin>
****************************************************************************************************

Plugins are included in POM file 
→ each plugin can have multiple goals.
→ we can specify the phase from where plugin should start it’s execution.
→ maven uses “archetype” plugin to create a project!

Package -- compiles and packages the files (in jar if jar is specified in the POM file) and places the jar file in the target directory.
Install -- compiles and packages the code and place it in the local repository for other projects to use it.
→ EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
Dependencies can be added in the pom file with the UIDs and system path specified!
(scope as system)

$ mvn site (creates the documentation in the target folder).


Dependencies vs plugins
we can say, plugin is a Jar file which executes the task, and dependency is a Jar which provides the class files to execute the task

→ Maven creates the documentation using a documentation-processing engine called Doxia

→ mvn clean package -U (Updates the versions i.e. SNAPSHOT)

→ Multi-module projects

Common dependencies can be placed in a parent pom file. (Transitive Dependency Mechanism)
 -P specifies which profile Maven is to run under. Projects can define multiple profiles which may pull in different dependencies, so this is required if you have a project that can do that.

-D define a system property


run.sh  script in the main module
#!/bin/sh

CLASSPATH=

for f in target/*.jar; do
CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f;
done

for f in target/lib/*.jar; do
CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f;
done

<goal>copy-dependencies</goal>
</goals>
<configuration>

</executions>
</plugin>

mvn flags::
-am → also make i.e. if some project is specified then also build the other required modules (for dependencies issues).
-pl → builds the specified project not all of them.
-P → activates the specified profiles
PROFILES
Profiles are alternative set of configurations thats sets or overrides the default values. We can customize the build configuration using profile. Then we can use flag to tell maven to execute goals with specific profile.
<profiles> (1)			//overrides the default maven’s compile configuration
            <profile>
                <id>production</id> (2)
                    <build> (3)
                            <plugins>

                            </plugins>
                    </build>
            </profile>
    </profiles>
→ It overrides the default settings thus it is written in the end of the pom file.
→ it can have any tag/element that a <project> tag can have.
→ it is executed using -P<profile id> flag
	Eg	mvn install -Pproduction

→ To skip test at command line
 mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true


MAVEN_OPTS
MAVEN_OPTS is used to configure a bit of extra memory for Maven as it will run an embedded Apache Tomcat application server with Alfresco Repo, Share, and Solr web applications deployed. It also sets the Spring Loaded Java Agent so it is available during Rapid Application Development (RAD).
→ This variable contains parameters used to start up the JVM running Maven and can be used to supply additional options to globally to Maven. E.g. JVM memory settings could be defined with the value -Xms256m -Xmx512m.

→ Open your mvn.sh file and add the following line:
export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m
this will allow to specify java heap space based on your project needs.

Read more: https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/08/increase-heap-size-maven-ant.html#ixzz67E1D95eD

JAVA_OPTS
JAVA_OPTS is the standard environment variable that some servers and other java apps append to the call that executes the java command.
For example in tomcat if you define JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx1024m', the startup script will execute java org.apache.tomcat.Servert -Xmx1024m
If you are running in Linux/OSX, you can set the JAVA_OPTS, right before you call the startup script by doing
JAVA_OPTS='-Djava.awt.headless=true'

JAVA
INTERFACE (total abstraction)
If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then the class must be declared abstract. That means all the methods in an interface are declared with an empty body and are public and all fields are public, static and final by default.
Interfaces are used to implement abstraction. So the question arises why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?
The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in interface are final, public and static.
JAVA ENUM
Enums are used when we know all possible values at compile time, such as choices on a menu, rounding modes, command line flags, etc. It is not necessary that the set of constants in an enum type stay fixed for all time.
In Java (from 1.5), enums are represented using enum data type. Java enums are more powerful than C/C++ enums . In Java, we can also add variables, methods and constructors to it. The main objective of enum is to define our own data types(Enumerated Data Types).
Java Enum internally inherits the Enum class, so it cannot inherit any other class
It is possible for a Java enum class to have abstract methods too. If an enum class has an abstract method, then each instance of the enum class must implement it.
Using an abstract method is useful when you need a different implementation of a method for each instance of a Java enum.
Enum cannot inherit any class but can implement interfaces.
ENUM SET
EnumSet<Level> enumSet = EnumSet.of(Level.HIGH, Level.MEDIUM);
ENUM MAP
Java also contains a special Java Map implementation which can use Java enum instances as keys. Here is a Java EnumMap example:
EnumMap<Level, String> enumMap = new EnumMap<Level, String>(Level.class);
enumMap.put(Level.HIGH  , "High level");
enumMap.put(Level.MEDIUM, "Medium level");
enumMap.put(Level.LOW   , "Low level");
String levelValue = enumMap.get(Level.HIGH);
JAVA JDBC
Java Database Connectivity.
It’s a java API ( to connect and execute the query with the database.)
It uses drivers to connect to the databases:
JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver, (Open Database Connectivity → ODBC by microsoft)
Native Driver,
Network Protocol Driver, and
Thin Driver
Earlier it used to be ODBC api but it was written in C (platform dependent) thus came JDBC.
General steps:
Register the Driver class (using forName() of Class)		Class.forName(“com.mysql.jdbc.Driver);
Create connection (getConnection() method of DriverManager class)  			Connection conn=DriverManager.getConnection(”jdbc:mysql;://localhost:3306/db”,”parul”,”Kritter12!”);
Create statement (createStatement() method of Connection interface)			Statement st=conn.createStatement();
Execute queries (executeQuery() method of Statement interface)				Statement, CallableStatement,and PreparedStatement interfaces		Resultset rs=st.executeQuery(“select * from cust”);
Close connection									conn.close();
For Statement interface → createStatement();
For PreparedStatement Interface → prepareStatement(); (extends Statement and you can give dynamic arguments as well!)
TRANSACTION
It’s like a group of sql queries.
Have commit() and rollback() methods!
 
BATCH PROCESSING
Groups related sql queries and submit them at once to the database thus decreasing the communication call.
The following method calls determines if jdbc driver supports batch mode or not!
DatabaseMetaData dm=con.getMetaData();
System.out.println(dm.supportsBatchUpdates());
addbatch() → to add statements to the batch to be executed.
executebatch() → starts the execution of a batch.returns an array of integers, and each element of the array represents the update count for the respective update statement.
clearbatch() removes all the statements.
 
 
SINGLETON CLASS 
A design pattern.
Means define a class with only one instance which can be globally accessed.
A class must ensure that only a single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.
Two types:
Early instantiation → at load time( we create the instance of the class at the time of declaring the static data member, so instance of the class is created at the time of classloading.).
Lazy instantiation → at required time(we create the instance of the class in synchronized method or synchronized block, so instance of the class is created when required.) synchronize method will block the object for it’s use so it can’t be accessed by any other class.
To have a singleton class, we need to have 1. A static member (object as it will take memory only once), 2. A private constructor → as it will protect the constructor to create  an object from outside the class, 3. Static factory method to give the object a global point of access.
SETS
It’s an interface which extends Collection class.
Unordered collection in which duplicates are not allowed.
Has methods like add,remove,clear,size to enhance functionality.
Sets are implemented in Enumset,hashset,linkedhashset,treeset :: 
java.util.EnumSet
java.util.HashSet
java.util.LinkedHashSet
java.util.TreeSet
Each of these Set implementations behaves a little differently with respect to the order of the elements when iterating the Set, and the time (big O notation) it takes to insert and access elements in the sets.
HashSet is backed by a HashMap. It makes no guarantees about the sequence of the elements when you iterate them.
LinkedHashSet differs from HashSet by guaranteeing that the order of the elements during iteration is the same as the order they were inserted into the LinkedHashSet. Reinserting an element that is already in the LinkedHashSet does not change this order.
TreeSet also guarantees the order of the elements when iterated, but the order is the sorting order of the elements. In other words, the order in which the elements would be sorted if you used a Collections.sort() on a List or array containing these elements. This order is determined either by their natural order (if they implement Comparable), or by a specific Comparator implementation.
JAVA ABSTRACT CLASSES
Abstract class in Java is similar to interface except that it can contain default method implementation. An abstract class can have an abstract method without body and it can have methods with implementation also.
only an abstract class can contain abstract methods
In Java, it is mandatory to override abstract methods of the superclass in the subclass.
The subclass of abstract class in java must implement all the abstract methods unless the subclass is also an abstract class.
Java Abstract class can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods.
 
READING WRITING TO DISK FILE 
FileWriter when writes is less.
BufferedWriter wraps another writer (FileWriter)!
 
Simple Logging Facade for JAVA(SLF4J)
→ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWHYrCXIL38
The need for logging the errors and messages!
Store those logs to a file for future reference!
Java.util.logging package with Logger which has a static method called getLogger().  (built in library since jdk 1.4)
It’s a facade that is not doing the actual work but is connecting to other log libraries that do the actual work (like log4j)!
SLF4J is like an API that only has an interface implementation so the actual work is still not done by SLF4J but some other connected logging library!
We need to have a jar of slf4j that is compatible with whatever log library we will be using and that jar again calls the library’s jar file!
Logback and log4j2 are the successors of log4J library!
 
ROLLINGFILEAPPENDER
RollingFileAppender extends FileAppender to backup the log files when they reach a certain size.
 
→ BasicConfigurator.configure () creates a console appender and configures the codes for simple logging.
→ if we want to direct the logs to another file we need to have appenders!
→ We can log into databases,files,console,Unix Syslog.
→ log4j has three main components:
loggers: Responsible for capturing logging information.
appenders: Responsible for publishing logging information to various preferred destinations.
layouts: Responsible for formatting logging information in different styles.
→ in properties if we specify WARN then only warnings and logs that have higher levels will be recorded not the info and debug as they have lower levels! As ALL < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL < OFF.
To write your logging information into multiple files, you would have to use org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender class
To write your logging information into files on a daily basis, you would have to use org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender class which extends the FileAppender class and inherits all its properties.
 
APACHE VELOCITY
It’s main purpose is to divide the static content and the design part of your code!
It’s a template engine which combines data and template.
You give variables and references and html page would be created!
Used as View component in MVC framework!
It can generate XML,SQL, and other text formatted files but mostly for dynamic web pages.
Initialize the velocity engine
Read the template
Put the data model in context object
Merge the template with context data and render the view
The primary job of the Velocity Engine is to generate content based on a template.
Velocity is a useful tool for rendering the dynamic web pages.
Any application working with velocity requires 2 parts:
A velocity template “xyz.vm”
A java file “abc.java”
 
TESTING 
Java has some testing frameworks like JUnit, TestNG.
TestNG (Next Generation)
→ It’s an open source testing framework used for automation testing suite.
→  It can generates logs and html files
→ you can group the test cases unlike JUnit.
→ you can control the test cases like the pre-tests, etc.
→ TestNG supports three additional levels such as @Before/After suite, @Before/AfterTest, and Before/AfterGroup i.e. multiple before and after annotations!
→ Dependent methods are there which works for the same class or inherited class in which even if the test fails you still have the decision power of executing the dependent test method or not.
→ We can create an xml file as well that will group the tests. Make suites.
→We can disable the test cases (either in xml file or @test annotation)
→  @test (enabled=false)! 
→ in xml file we can use include and exclude!
→ Groups are specified in the testng.xml file with <groups> tag. Groups can be specified either in the <suite> tag or <test> tag. If the <groups> tag is specified inside the <suite> tag, then it is applied to all the <test> tags of XML file. If the <groups> tag is specified within a particular <test> folder, then it is applied to that particular <test> tag only.
→ a test can belong to multiple groups.
@Test(groups= {"Group A","Group B"})  
→ @parameters have <name value> pair in xml file.
→ Listeners are implemented by the ITestListener interface. 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
JMockit
http://abhinandanmk.blogspot.com/2012/06/jmockit-tutoriallearn-it-today-with.html
 
https://jmockit.github.io/tutorial/Introduction.html
It’s a library/mock framework that mocks the methods that are called from within a function and we are not testing those methods so we just make mocks for them, mocks object.
It's used when we don’t want to call any third party class/entity to be executed just for the sake of testing! (Database wala example)
So basically mocking is, as the name says, redefining the behaviour of an object or method to imitate or modify the original implementation to accommodate our test cases.
JMockit Expectations class is used for mocking the results of a method by specifying what is expected when a particular method is invoked!
Setting of expectations is called “record phase”
When the actual call happens that is called “reply phase”
@Mocked annotation is used for object/method to be mocked.
we have the mocking API (also known as the "Expectations" API), intended for tests which use mocked dependencies. Finally, there is a small faking API (aka the "Mockups" API), which can be used for the creation and application of fake implementations that avoid the full cost of external components.
 
Base64
It’s also called Privacy Enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM).
Base64 encoding converts binary data into text format.
Primarily used in email encryption process.
Three types of encoding and decoding classes:: 
Basic encoding and decoding
It uses the Base64 alphabet specified by Java in RFC 4648 and RFC 2045 for encoding and decoding operations. The encoder does not add any line separator character. The decoder rejects data that contains characters outside the base64 alphabet.
URL and filename encoding and decoding
It uses the Base64 alphabet specified by Java in RFC 4648 for encoding and decoding operations. The encoder does not add any line separator character. The decoder rejects data that contains characters outside the base64 alphabet.
MIME
It uses the Base64 alphabet as specified in RFC 2045 for encoding and decoding operations. The encoded output must be represented in lines of no more than 76 characters each and uses a carriage return '\r' followed immediately by a linefeed '\n' as the line separator. No line separator is added to the end of the encoded output. All line separators or other characters not found in the base64 alphabet table are ignored in decoding operation.

TOMCAT
→ to start tomcat
$ /var/app/kritter/adserving/apache-tomcat-7.0.47/bin$ sudo ./startup.sh
JAVA SERVLETS(Server Component)
→ It’s a way to construct dynamic web pages using java.
→ servlets are the Java programs that runs on the Java-enabled web server or application server.
→ Its the helper application which helps in building the dynamic web pages!
→ It resides on server performs the action there and sends the result back to the client.
→ We can implement servlet interface or extend  genericservlet interface or extend httpservlet class.
→ service() method is implemented with 2 objects:: 
Request object (from client to server)
Response object (from server to client)
→ For mapping to the servlet we have “web.xml” file aka deployment descriptor that maps the request. It contains info like for which request which servlet to be called!
→ all this is taken care by tomcat i.e. the web container!!
→ Instead of xml files for mapping we now have annotations that does the job!
We have javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages that have interfaces and classes for servlet api. (http wala has the protocol thats the only difference)
Lifecycle of servlet interface: 
Initialize the servlet (init)
Service the servlet (service)
Destroy the servlet (destroy)
